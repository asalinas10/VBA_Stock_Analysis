# Stock Analysis using VBA

In this challenge I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data from 2018-2020 to determine characteristics and analyze trends of individual stocks.

The characteristics I looked for are ticker name, yearly change in stock price, percent change in stock price, and total stock volume.

For each year I looked and found stocks that had the single highest percentege increase and decrease, and largest total stock volume.


# Summary:

In this challenge I was given a data set that yearly stock information.
