# Stock Analysis using VBA

In this challenge I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data from 2018-2020 to determine characteristics and analyze trends of individual stocks.

The characteristics I looked for are ticker name, yearly change in stock price, percent change in stock price, and total stock volume.

For each year I looked and found stocks that had the single highest percentege increase and decrease, and largest total stock volume.


# Summary:

In this challenge I was given a data set with yearly stock information.

The steps to do this goes as follows:

    1. Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

            - The ticker symbol

            - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

            - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

            - The total stock volume of the stock.

    2. Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".


* In resources folder are files that contain data. 
    - alphabetical_testing.xlsm contains test data to test script more quickly
    - Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm contains stock data used for project

With this information I determined the characterics and trends from above and presented as follows.
